       <li> My name is Britney Quebrada, and my major is Computer Science with business concentration. I am a very active and energetic person who loves to go on adventures. I love to go hiking, and I do it about twice a week. Hiking is a great way to unwind, and it comes with beautiful views along the way. Continuing, I also love to play soccer, and I play it almost everyday. Furthermore, music and binge watching is my go-to when I just want to sit back and relax. </li>
